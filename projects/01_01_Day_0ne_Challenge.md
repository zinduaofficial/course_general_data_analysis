# Day 1 Challenge
## Determine the difference between SQL and No-SQL.

In subsequent days, you will be practising SQL Queries, but first you need to understand the fundamentals of Relational and Non Relational Databases. 

You can find the SQL queries related project description and starter code on GitHub Classroom through this link:

**NOTE:** For the challenges listed, you will be not be expected to submit your codes, instead the technical mentor will share the solutions for the SQL related questions by the end of the week. 

For Day 1, you are expected to write, in your markdown, at least 5 differences between SQL and No-SQL Databases.
