        "### Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Data is at the core of how modern applications and websites function. Whether it's comments on a viral video, changing scores in a multiplayer game, or items in your shopping cart, all this information is stored in a **database**.\n",
        "\n",

        "### Relational Databases\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the 1970s, most **Database Management Systems (DBMSs)** have been built around the **relational model**. In this model:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Relations** are the primary structure, known in practice as **tables**.\n",
        "- A **relation** consists of **tuples** (rows) and **attributes** (columns).\n",
        "\n",
        "Each tuple represents a unique instance of an entity—such as an employee, a sale, or a test result. For example, a table of teachers might have attributes like `name`, `subjects`, and `start_date`.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Primary Keys\n",
        "\n",
        "A **primary key** is a column that uniquely identifies each row in a table. For instance, in a teachers table, a column called `employee_ID` can serve as a primary key, with values that auto-increment to ensure uniqueness.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Foreign Keys\n",
        "\n",
        "To relate two tables, you use a **foreign key**. A foreign key is a column in one table that references the **primary key** of another. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `EMPLOYEES.employee_ID` can be used as a foreign key in the `SALES` table to link sales to employees.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Querying Data\n",
        "\n",
        "Relational databases use **Structured Query Language (SQL)** to retrieve and manipulate data. SQL allows filtering, sorting, and transforming data with precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "Popular open-source **RDBMSs** include:\n",
        "\n",

        "While the relational model is widely used, it isn't ideal for every use case—particularly when working with unstructured data or scaling horizontally. This has led to the rise of **non-relational databases**, commonly referred to as **NoSQL databases**.\n",
        "\n",
        "NoSQL databases use a variety of data models and typically do not rely on SQL, instead using their own unique syntaxes.\n",

        "- Store data as structured **documents**, typically in JSON or BSON format.\n",
        "- Each document has a unique key.\n",
        "- Suitable for nested and semi-structured data.\n",
        "- Example: **MongoDB**\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 3. Columnar Databases\n",
        "\n",
        "- Store data **by column** instead of by row.\n",
        "- Efficient for analytical queries and large datasets.\n",
        "- Each column is stored separately, improving read performance.\n",

        "- The **primary key** uniquely identifies one and only one instance of an entity.\n",
        "- An entity can have multiple unique attributes, but one is chosen as the **primary key**.\n",
        "- In the `EMPLOYEE` table, `ID` can be the primary key since it is unique for each employee.\n",
        "- Other unique attributes like `License_Number` or `Passport_Number` could also serve as primary keys depending on requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Candidate Key\n",
        "\n",
        "- A **candidate key** is an attribute or set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple.\n",

        "- A **super key** is a set of one or more attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple.\n",
        "- Every candidate key is a super key, but not all super keys are candidate keys.\n",
        "- Super keys may contain extra attributes not needed for uniqueness.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example**:\n",
        "- In the `EMPLOYEE` table, a combination like `(EMPLOYEE_ID, EMPLOYEE_NAME)` is a super key, even though `EMPLOYEE_ID` alone is sufficient.\n",

        "#### 4. Foreign Key\n",
        "\n",
        "- A **foreign key** is a column in one table that refers to the **primary key** of another table.\n",

        "- The `EMPLOYEE` table includes `Department_ID` as a **foreign key** to link to the department.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. Alternate Key\n",
        "\n",
        "- When a relation has multiple candidate keys, the one not chosen as the primary key is called an **alternate key**.\n",
        "- There may be zero or more alternate keys.\n",

        "  - If `Employee_Id` is chosen as the primary key, then `PAN_No` becomes the alternate key.\n",

        "- A **composite key** is a primary key composed of more than one attribute.\n",
