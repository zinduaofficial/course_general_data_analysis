### Pushed to the Advanced ML Course
The following are gaps from the foundations course that will be covered in the Advanced Machine Learning Course:
- **Anomaly Detection (Outliers):** Ideally covered when going through clustering
- **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Feature Selection, Dimensionality Reduction, and Discriminant Analysis

Here are some projects pushed to Advanced ML course since they require the three concepts above:
- [Brain Tumor Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri) (Involves image processing)
- [Advanced House Price Regression](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) (Involves advanced feature engineering)

**Note:** There's quite a number of machine learning projects across all level on [this blog by Project Pro](https://www.projectpro.io/article/top-10-machine-learning-projects-for-beginners-in-2021/397)
